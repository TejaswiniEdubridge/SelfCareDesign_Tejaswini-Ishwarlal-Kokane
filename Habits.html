  <h4>Do Something Just for Fun</h4>
  <p>Crank up the music and dance. Laugh with your kids. Play a game. Write. Buy flowers. Follow your passions. Attend a fun event. The real <abbr title="Return on Investment">ROI</abbr>? A better, more energized, happier self.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Be Adventurous</h4>
  <p>Get outside your comfort zone. Be brave. Challenge yourself. Whether that be a backpacking trip, trying a new activity, or pushing yourself physically, mentally or emotionally, you’ll feel proud, confident and strong.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h4>Treat Yourself and Your Body</h4>
  <p>When you look good, you feel good. Get a haircut, have your nails done, enjoy a facial, manicure or pedicure. When we take care of how we look physically, we feel better emotionally. </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Spend Time with Those You Love</h4>
  <p>Schedule a date night with your partner, a special day with your kiddo or happy hour with your BFF. Studies prove that people who socialize often have higher levels of happiness. This doesn’t have to be face-to-face; sometimes a phone call is all you need (and can fit in!). </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h4>Express Gratitude</h4>
  <p> In order to live a life we love, we must first love the life we live. Research continues to surface on the science and benefits of gratitude. Being grateful is one of the simplest, yet most powerful, things you can do to take care of yourself.</p>
